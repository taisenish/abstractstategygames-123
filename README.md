# Abstract Strategy Games

A Java terminal-based application that implements multiple abstract strategy board games: **Tic-Tac-Toe**, **Connect Four**, and **Five in a Row (Gomoku)**. Designed with extensibility in mind using object-oriented principles such as inheritance and polymorphism.

##  Overview

This project offers a unified game engine for playing classic turn-based strategy games against another human player via the console. Each game is built on a shared interface that makes it easy to extend or modify.

##  Games Included

- **Tic-Tac-Toe** – 3x3 grid, win by getting 3 in a row
- **Connect Four** – Drop tokens into a 7x6 grid, get 4 in a row
- **Five in a Row (Gomoku)** – Free-form 15x15 grid, win with 5 in a row

All games share the same core engine but have unique rules and display logic.

##  Features

- Console-based user interface
- Object-oriented design using abstract base class
- Game replay/reset functionality
- Win condition checks for each game type
- Clear separation of logic and user interaction
